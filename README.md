### SOLID principle in go

- Single responsibilty
- Open for extension, close for modification
- Liskov substitution principle: the super class should be replacable with objects of subclass without affecting the correctness of program
- Interface segregation principle: split interface into smaller
- Dependencies inversion: high level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but rather both should depend on abstraction
